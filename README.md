- You have to run and reach the end of the jungle. 
- While running, you have to collect the fruits. Which will help you score points. 
- You will also have to avoid the spikes. They will result in instant death
- Each fruit gives you 10 points. 
- You can take small jumps and long jumps. 
- Please note, although taking long jumps can help you it comes with its limitations. After a long jump, the player might fall with a lot of speed and
