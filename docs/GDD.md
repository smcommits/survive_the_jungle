# Game Design Development

Survive The Jugnle is a 2D Platformer Game. Player will have to collect eatbles to achieve score while avoiding lethal obstacles. 

# Look and Feel

The look and feel of Surve the Jungle is a mixed case. The gamplay feels a lot mario. The game theme is inspired by the Jumanji game. 

# Game Design

1. The intial step in designing the is to create a map. A world in which game will occur. The game map map is shifts towards left as the player keeps on moving. So that the player can keep on disovering the world. 
2. To create the map I have made use of something that is called a tilemap and tilsets. Tilesets are nothing but small images. Somwhere around 32x32 pixels. Like a drawing canvas, we just keep on placing these small boxes or pictures until we come up with a ultimate worl. 
3. The placement of all the small images and collection of those is called a tilemap. It is nothing just a spreadsheet of location for each tile. 
4. After the world, biggest challenge in the game is to craete a player that belongs to the map. 
5. The player has to survive the jungle. While trying to collect as many fruits as they can. 
6. While trying to collect fruits, player will also have to take obstacles in the path. 
7. The obstacles cause sudden death resulting in game over.
